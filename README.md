## 📌 Project 

Facial Expression Recognition using CNN

- Developed a CNN-based Facial Expression Recognition (FER) system using TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV to classify human emotions, a key problem in Human–Computer Interaction (HCI).

 - Enhanced model robustness under real-world lighting and noise conditions using digital image processing techniques such as HE, CLAHE, LBP, Canny Edge Detection, and PCA.

 - Implemented face detection using Haar Cascade Classifier and trained the model on normalized grayscale facial images (48×48).

 - Achieved reliable emotion prediction with confidence scores, validating performance on unseen test images.
