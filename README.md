# Facial_Expression_Recognition 
using CNN with Digital Image Processing Enhancements

Human–Computer Interaction (HCI) systems heavily depend on accurate and reliable Facial Expression
Recognition (FER) to interpret human emotions effectively. However, achieving high accuracy in FER
remains challenging due to several real-world factors.

# Digital Image Processing Techniques

Histogram Equalization (HE)
Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE)
Local Binary Patterns (LBP)
Canny Edge Detection
Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
